## Instructions:
1. **Sauté the onions and garlic**: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and garlic, sauté until soft and fragrant.
2. **Add the pumpkin**: Add the cubed pumpkin to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. **Add the stock**: Pour the vegetable stock into the pot, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender.
4. **Blend the soup**: Using an immersion blender (or a regular blender in batches), blend the soup until smooth and creamy.
5. **Add coconut milk**: Stir in the coconut milk and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with pumpkin seeds, if desired.
